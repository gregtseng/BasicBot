# BasicBot

Before working on this, I strongly advise listening to a Cascada song.
Seriously, go to youtube and put in "Everytime We Touch", "Miracle" or something.
Now you understand the level of emotion I want this chatbot to give the illusion of possessing

I also just consider it best practice to listen to Cascada while coding. That is my muse.

Chatbot fueled by dredged Facebook Data. "Personality" should be KCT: 
Kesha's vocabulary (and parsing/generating of euphamisms), 
Cascada's emotional tone, and the 
thirst of a Thurston hoe. 

Lamentably in Java. May soon be refactored in perl.

I really do not care about commenting.
Or formatting.
Or naming.

if it speaks to you, include it
